# INTELLISALES

### Idea Behind The Project

Creative projects are the tangible products of creative behaviour and creative thinking and we were privileged to work upon such platform. The basic idea behind this project is for our community help. In day to day lifestyle we all might have come across many such technical and analytical problems which seems to be small for us but appears as a big rock for others. Shopkeepers, retailers, chemists and druggist etc. are few examples who don't have the exposure to a software wherein they can enter their purchased products and have a schematic system to discover their daily profits and sale. Our software Intellisales targets on data entry of units along with specific quantity and price range. The main advantage that the seller would witness through this platform is that when a specific unit is ceased to get terminated the software would address a disclaimer to the seller for further purchase from the particular dealer.


### Data Insights 

Basically Intellisales focusses on data insights, to be more precised data insights is the knowledge that a software or firm gains from analyzing sets of information pertaining to a given topic or situation. Various insights come into play like the operational, strategic, performance etc. Intellisales is a software which not only focuses on the functioning but pertains the ability to relate with the diurnal level of decisions.


### Pricing

Profit margin or price forecasting is a prediction of the price of a product based on demand as well as seasonal trends. With Artificial Intelligence a Profit margin feature could help the seller to achieve much more than just the price prediction.

Applications of AI for retail stores could help businesses set prices for their products, visualizing the likely outcomes of multiple pricing strategies. To be able to execute this, systems collect information about other products, promotional activities, sales figures, and additional data. Price optimization stays flexible with respect to the software that is it would have the ability to adjust the prices and promotions according to the information obtained.

### Future Scope with AI

Future scope is the part of project planning that involves determining and documenting a list of specific project goals, deliverables, features, functions, tasks, deadlines, and ultimately costs. In other words, it is what needs to be achieved and the work that must be done to deliver a project. These days, every project and software realizes the need for having a website and are putting in efforts to design and develop the best site for taking their products or services online. This is where we can see a great deal of scope for web development and design.

Our software too apprehends towards such development like time taken by the products to expire, most and least profitable items and linear regression. It is basically a logic wherein expiry date of a product is measured from date of purchase itself and not from its packaging date.

There are few items which are in sale for daily use whereas few amongst them are monthly basis. The scope of this thought is that the supplier would get a report regarding the profit he has gained from a particular item at the end of 1 Quarter, in short a detailed plan for his most and least profitable items.
